Number system conversion program in C
The program should convert the given numbers to the specified base


Usage:
The number and base can be passed in the commandline as arguments argv[1] and argv[2] respectively.

Failure to pass the input as argument, the user is prompted to pass the input during program execution.

At the moment, the program is lacking several features especially checking input validity. Another known problem is failure to put into consideration alphabets of hexadecimal base.

The program is work in progress and overtime the features will be fully be implemented
